# Azure Red Hat OpenShift (ARO) Stretch Challenges Guide

This guide outlines additional stretch challenges for teams who have successfully deployed the Task Manager application to ARO. These challenges will help you explore advanced ARO features and optimize your deployment.

## Challenge 1: OpenShift DevOps Integration

Enhance your deployment process by integrating with OpenShift's built-in DevOps capabilities.

### Objectives:

1. **Implement OpenShift Pipelines (Tekton)**:
   - Create a pipeline that builds, tests, and deploys your application
   - Configure triggers for automated pipeline execution
   - Integrate your pipeline with your GitHub repository

2. **Set Up OpenShift GitOps (ArgoCD)**:
   - Implement GitOps principles for your application deployment
   - Configure ArgoCD to sync your Kubernetes manifests from GitHub
   - Implement a progressive delivery strategy


## Challenge 2: Advanced Scaling and Resilience

Implement advanced scaling and resilience features to make your application more robust.

### Objectives:

1. **Implement Horizontal Pod Autoscaling**:
   - Configure HPA based on CPU/memory metrics
   - Test the scaling behavior under load
   - Optimize scaling thresholds based on application behavior

2. **Set Up Custom Metrics-Based Scaling**:
   - Deploy Prometheus and configure custom metrics
   - Create HPAs based on application-specific metrics
   - Demonstrate scaling based on metrics like request rate or queue length

3. **Implement Pod Disruption Budgets**:
   - Configure PDBs to ensure availability during cluster maintenance
   - Test the behavior during simulated maintenance events


## Challenge 3: Service Mesh Implementation

Implement an OpenShift Service Mesh to enhance application networking, security, and observability.

### Objectives:

1. **Deploy Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh**:
   - Install the Service Mesh Operator
   - Configure a ServiceMeshControlPlane resource
   - Enroll your application in the service mesh

2. **Implement Advanced Traffic Management**:
   - Create traffic routing rules (e.g., canary deployments)
   - Configure circuit breakers and fault injection
   - Demonstrate traffic splitting between different versions

3. **Enhance Security with mTLS**:
   - Configure mutual TLS between services
   - Implement security policies
   - Verify encrypted communication

4. **Implement Distributed Tracing**:
   - Configure Jaeger for distributed tracing
   - Instrument your application with tracing headers
   - Analyze and optimize request flows


## Challenge 4: Advanced Security Hardening

Enhance the security posture of your ARO deployment with advanced security features.

### Objectives:

1. **Implement Security Context Constraints**:
   - Create custom SCCs for your application
   - Apply least privilege principles
   - Ensure workloads run with minimal permissions

2. **Configure Network Policies**:
   - Implement fine-grained network policies
   - Restrict communication between components
   - Test isolation and allowed paths
